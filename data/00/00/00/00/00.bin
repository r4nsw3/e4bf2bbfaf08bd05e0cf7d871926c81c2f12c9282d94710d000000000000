  |   Use your alchemic abilities to escape the island in this brutally     |
  |   challenging 2D action-platformer with no checkpoints. You'll get      |
  |   better... eventually.                                                 |

  |   Dead Cells puts you in control of a failed alchemic experiment        |
  |   trying to figure out what's happening on a sprawling, ever-changing   |
  |   and seemingly cursed Island. Tough but fair combat, responsive        |
  |   controls, challenging foes, permadeath and of course, the emergency   |
  |   panic roll to get you out of trouble, make for a demanding,           |
  |   visceral and cathartic action game.                                   |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Experience a Roguevania, mixing an interconnected world, branching    |
  |   paths and unlockable skills with the constant adrenaline-pumping      |
  |   threat of permadeath. No checkpoints. You either vanquish the final   |
  |   boss in one go, or you try again. However, you keep some of your      |
  |   progress for successive runs; new paths you've unlocked, access to    |
  |   new levels, mutations, abilities and weapons.                         |
  |                                                                         |
